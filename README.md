# calculator
An on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The calculator is capable of adding, substracting, multiplying, and dividing. When an expression of an operand, an operator, and another operator are entered, the resulting expression is evaluated and displayed.

If '=' is pressed before entering all of the numbers or an operator, it is ignored. Pressing clear wipes any existing data. If an operator is entered when the calculator is expecting another operand, it replaces the previously entered operator in the current expression. After pressing '=', a result is displayed. Pressing a new digit after this clears the result and starts a new calculation.
